# Vercel Alternatives – Free Migration Tool

**Find the best alternative to Vercel for your web project, instantly!**

## 🚀 Overview

This project is an interactive web-based tool designed to help developers find the ideal alternative to Vercel for deploying their web projects. By answering five quick questions about your needs (project type, budget, priorities, team size, and migration urgency), you’ll receive personalized recommendations for platforms that best fit your requirements—from Cloudflare Pages and Netlify to Railway, Render, Fly.io, Coolify, Replit, and DigitalOcean App Platform.

## 🧐 Why?

Vercel is popular for deploying Next.js and other modern web projects, but it may not be the perfect fit for everyone due to pricing, features, or other reasons. This tool helps you:

- Quickly discover the best alternatives tailored to your needs.
- Understand the unique features, pricing, and docs for each platform.
- Migrate away from Vercel with confidence—whether you want a free tier, need a self-hosted solution, or require enterprise-grade performance.
